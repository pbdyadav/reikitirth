  <h2>Biography of Dr. Chujiro Hayashi (1880-1940)</h2>
  <h3 className="subtitle">Reiki Master & Naval Officer</h3>

  {/* Early Life */}

        <h3>Early Life and Family Background</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Chujiro Hayashi was born in <strong>1880</strong> in Tokyo, Japan, during a period of 
          modernization and transformation in Japanese society following the Meiji Restoration. 
          Unlike Mikao Usui, who was born into a more spiritually oriented household, 
          Hayashi's early years were influenced by Japan's emerging emphasis on science, discipline, 
          and national development. His upbringing instilled in him a balance of discipline, order, 
          and responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a young man, he displayed a natural aptitude for leadership and service, 
          qualities that would later define his dual legacy as both a naval officer and a 
          dedicated Reiki master. His exposure to both military rigor and spiritual practice 
          made him uniquely positioned to carry forward and systematize Reiki teachings.
        </p>

        {/* Naval Career */}
        <h3>Naval Career and Military Service</h3>
        <p>
          Hayashi pursued a career in the <strong>Imperial Japanese Navy</strong>, one of the most prestigious 
          institutions in Japan at the time. He studied at the <strong>Naval Academy</strong>, where he learned 
          discipline, medical knowledge, leadership, and organizational skills. These qualities 
          became invaluable later in his work with Reiki.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Naval Training</strong> - He underwent rigorous physical and mental training, 
          shaping his character with discipline and endurance.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical Knowledge</strong> - During his service, he was exposed to anatomy, 
          first-aid methods, and naval medical practices, which enhanced his understanding of healing.</li>
          <li><strong>Leadership Skills</strong> - Rising to the rank of <strong>Naval Officer</strong>, 
          he gained practical experience in organization, command, and team management.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By the time he retired, Hayashi had not only served his country with honor but also 
          developed the structured thinking and discipline that would later shape the way he taught Reiki.
        </p>

        {/* Encounter with Usui */}
        <h3>Meeting Dr. Mikao Usui</h3>
        <p>
          In the early 1920s, after retiring from the navy, Hayashi met <strong>Dr. Mikao Usui</strong>, 
          the founder of Reiki. This meeting was a turning point in his life. Hayashi was drawn to Reiki 
          not only because of its healing potential but also because it resonated with his desire to 
          serve humanity in a peaceful and compassionate way, beyond military service.
        </p>
        <p>
          He became one of Usui's most dedicated students and was among the few to receive 
          the highest level of training in Reiki. Usui recognized his discipline, leadership, 
          and systematic mind, and entrusted him to carry Reiki forward after his passing.
        </p>

        {/* Founding Hayashi Reiki Kenkyukai */}
        <h3>Establishing the Hayashi Reiki Kenkyukai</h3>
        <p>
          After Usui's death in 1926, Hayashi continued to practice and teach Reiki with great dedication. 
          In 1927, he founded the <strong>Hayashi Reiki Kenkyukai</strong> (Hayashi Reiki Research Institute) 
          in Tokyo. This institute became a cornerstone in the history of Reiki.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clinic-Based Approach</strong> - Hayashi introduced Reiki in a more clinical setting, 
          where patients could receive treatments from multiple practitioners at once.</li>
          <li><strong>Systematic Training</strong> - He developed structured manuals and procedures for 
          Reiki practice, making it easier for students to learn and replicate.</li>
          <li><strong>Expansion of Reiki</strong> - His research institute attracted many students, 
          who later spread Reiki throughout Japan and internationally.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Hayashi's method emphasized a more medical-style application of Reiki, 
          while still retaining the spiritual essence taught by Usui. His approach bridged the gap between 
          traditional healing and modern medical practices.
        </p>

        {/* Reiki Techniques */}
        <h3>Contributions to Reiki Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Hayashi is credited with refining and systematizing many of the hand positions 
          still used in Reiki today. His contributions included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Standardized Hand Placements</strong> - He mapped out a set of positions covering 
          major organs and energy centers, creating a systematic treatment method.</li>
          <li><strong>Two-Practitioner Treatments</strong> - In his clinics, patients often received 
          healing from two practitioners simultaneously for greater effect.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical-Oriented Explanations</strong> - He explained Reiki treatments using medical 
          terms, making Reiki more acceptable to modern Japanese society.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These refinements helped Reiki gain credibility and consistency, ensuring that its 
          practice could be passed on in a clear and replicable way.
        </p>

        {/* Relationship with Takata */}
        <h3>Teaching Hawayo Takata</h3>
        <p>
          One of Hayashi's most significant contributions to Reiki's global spread was his 
          training of <strong>Hawayo Takata</strong>, a Japanese-American woman from Hawaii. 
          Takata came to Japan seeking healing and became one of his most devoted students. 
          After years of study, she received her Master training from Hayashi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through Takata, Reiki was later introduced to Hawaii and the West, 
          eventually spreading across the world. Without Hayashi's trust in Takata, 
          Reiki may not have reached beyond Japan.
        </p>

        {/* Final Years */}
        <h3>Final Years and Passing</h3>
        <p>
          In the late 1930s, Japan was once again on the path of war. As a former naval officer, 
          Hayashi was under pressure to return to military service. However, his devotion to 
          healing and peace conflicted with participating in war.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1940, at the age of 60, Hayashi chose to end his life in a ceremonial and honorable way 
          rather than be forced back into active military duty. His passing was a profound loss to 
          the Reiki community, but his legacy continued through his students.
        </p>

        {/* Legacy */}
        <h3>Legacy of Dr. Chujiro Hayashi</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Chujiro Hayashi played a crucial role in ensuring the survival and spread of Reiki. 
          His systematic approach made Reiki accessible, teachable, and respected. His key legacies include:
